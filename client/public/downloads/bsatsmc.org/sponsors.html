            </a>
            <p class="sponsor-container-sponsor-description"><strong>SyncThink</strong> is a leader in neuro-technology with foundational research in eye tracking metrics and devices. SyncThink recently received FDA clearance for its first medical device - EYE-SYNC. The EYE-SYNC device is an integrated head-mounted eye tracking device for rapid, reliable recording, viewing and analyzing of eye movement impairment through the use of virtual reality.&nbsp; Abnormal eye movement is one of the most common deficits after a concussion, an assessment EYE-SYNC yields in under 60 seconds.&nbsp;
              <br>
              <br>EYE-SYNC uses high-performance eye tracking technology to monitor eye movement in a handheld virtual reality environment. If your brain is out of sync after an incident, EYE-SYNC can notify the trainer in less than a medical timeout. In collaboration with the Brain Trauma Foundation, U.S. Army, and Stanford University, SyncThink has developed an eye tracking assessment that measures coordination with predictable movement visual motion, an essential brain function. EYE-SYNC is currently used on the sidelines of many top NCAA programs.</p>
