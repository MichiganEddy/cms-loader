He has extensively characterized sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in terms of clinical phenotype, pathological alterations, prion chemistry, and molecular genetics, and have found that specific features of the PrPsc molecule are remarkable predictors of phenotype.
                      <br>
                      <br>Further, Dr. Castellani has recently characterized a form of human prion disease characterized by “protease-sensitive PrPsc,” expanding the spectrum of disease and drawing even closer overlap with more common neurodegenerative diseases. His studies on Alzheimer’s disease relate to early events in disease progression; as such, he has &nbsp;found a number of adducts related to oxidative stress in vulnerable, but pathologically normal, neurons in Alzheimer’s disease, as well as in control brains several decades prior to the onset of neurodegeneration.</p>
